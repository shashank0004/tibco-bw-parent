# tibco-bw-parent

tibco-bw-parent is an Apache Maven parent POM that contains shared dependencies, properties, and plugins for TIBCO BW 6
shared modules and application modules and their application package projects.

This is an open source project for TIBCO BW 6 projects that leverage Maven for build automation. It is not affiliated nor
supported by TIBCO directly.

It is part of the ChrisJaehnen.org family of libraries and projects.

ChrisJaehnen.org libraries and projects are written in Java. The libraries provide extensions, helpers, and abstractions
to commonly used Java classes and technologies. The projects provide implementations that solve real world problems not
currently available on the market. Their goal is to provide 100% free, open source frameworks and solutions to Java
developers to simplify their solutions.

ChrisJaehnen.org libraries and project artifacts are distributed via the Apache Maven Central repository.
